	This is a wrapper over picard library writen in JRuby for a simple manipulating
of a VCF file. 
	The script is taking as parameter a ".vcf" file, which is opened
using "VCFFileReader" class. Then, using the iterator from this class, the
script iterates thorugh all the records of the file, for each of the record is
getting the alleles and for each of the allele is printing the DNA bases
segregating in this allele.
